# GFG-problems
Given a string S that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into N + 1 groups by N dashes. Also given an integer K. 

We want to reformat the string S, such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group,
which could be shorter than K but still must contain at least one character.

Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted string.
